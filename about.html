            <p>Today I am employed at Central Tech Hub, of which i started as their Administrative Assocaite but due to my knowledge acquired before I started the role in no time I was promoted from that position to Programs Manager, in addition a, currently working part-time with an international US based company in Ghana(Enlightened Grove)</p>
